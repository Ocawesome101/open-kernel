# open-kernel
A simple operating system for OpenComputers.

As of version 0.2.0 (I think), I am proud to say that Open Kernel uses a mere 80KB of RAM, compared to OpenOS' 170KB, on a Tier 1 stick of memory!

Now with external FS / floppy support!

I need to make sure GitHub doesn't overwrite this again....
